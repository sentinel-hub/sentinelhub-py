    "# Sharing Sentinel Hub authentication session\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of Sentinel Hub services require users to [authenticate](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/api/overview/authentication/) using Sentinel Hub OAuth client credentials. Each authentication creates a new authentication session that typically lasts `1` hour and cannot be cancelled. Users are highly encouraged to configure their processes in a way that **at any time there won't be more than 100 active authentication sessions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is implemented in a way that it automatically creates, caches, and reuses an authentication session within a single Python runtime process. Once the current session expires or the runtime process is restarted it will automatically create a new session. This way normal users don't have to worry about interacting with session objects directly. However, once users parallelize their processes over multiple Python processes or even over a cluster of multiple compute instances then they should make sure that a single authentication session is shared between all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's say a user splits their area of interest into a large number of smaller bounding boxes. Then they parallelize data download from Sentinel Hub over these bounding boxes using a few different Python processes. It depends on the type of parallelization, but without implementing a session sharing mechanism such a procedure could try to create a new authentication session for each small bounding box. In extreme cases that could fail because an **excessive number of authentication requests might be rate-limited by Sentinel Hub**.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",

    "This tutorial will explain the basic mechanism of working with sessions in `sentinelhub-py` and how to implement a session transfer for different types of parallelization. \n",
